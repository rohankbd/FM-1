## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt how to place different elements effectively using CSS custom properties and how it affects the behaviour of other elements.
The display property is still a tough nut to crack but I tried to implement the best of my knowledge of display property.

### Continued development

I would like to further better this project in the future as I learn new styling techniques.
